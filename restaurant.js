//import chefsOrder function from fishMonger.js

//define a function fishMenu that returns the HTML string of the menu
    //invoke chefsOrder argument with chefBudget as an argument and return chefsInventory
    //use a for loop to iterate through the chefsInventory array and return a template string with html text and species property that look like this:
    /* <h1>Menu</h1>
<article class="menu">
    <h2>Tuna</h2>
    <section class="menu__item">Tuna Soup</section>
    <section class="menu__item">Tuna Sandwich</section>
    <section class="menu__item">Grilled Tuna</section>
</article> */
    //chefBudget will be passed to the fishMenu function as the argument  and
    //passed to fishInspector function within fishMonger.js
//create function that looks into boatInventory <---LOL @ us
//other options:
    //invoke chefsOrder function outside of fishMenu function and call the modified array chefsInventory
        //pass mongerInventory and chefBudget as arguments
        //return chefsInventory
